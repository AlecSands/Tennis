        <h3>Basics</h3>
        <p>
          Before we can explore the different grips there are two topics that need to be understood:
          the organization of the handle on the raquet organization of the hand of the player,
          and how these two different organizations relate to each other.
        </p>
        <h5>The Handle</h5>
        <p>
          The handle is best understood when looking at the end or if you imagine cutting a cross-section
          through the handle and then viewing the cut.  When viewed this way we can see that the handle
          is an extruded hexagonal shape.  Each side of the hexagonal is referred to as a bevel.  Starting
          at the top bevel and working our way around we number from 1-4 (ie. bevel 1, bevel 2, etc.).
          This is the essential organization of the raquet handle.
        </p>
        <h5>The Hand</h5>
        <p>
          As it relates to the tennis grip, the hand is best understood with the front of the hand facing
          towards you in an open position.  Then if you imagine placing two stickers: one on you knuckle where
          your index finger meets your palm (point 1 in the diagram), and another at the base of your palm pad
          that align with your pinky finger (point 2 in the diagram).
        </p>
        <h5>Connection</h5>
        <p>
          The tennis grip is described using the intersection of these two organizations.  For example,
          the continental grip is described as occuring on bevel 2.  What does this mean?  This means that
          the two points that we indicated in the hand organization are both resting on bevel number 2
          on the raquet handle.  You are now ready to experiment with all the tennis grips!
